**Abstract**:\
In distributed systems like etcd, read index latency impacts the speed and efficiency of strongly consistent read operations. Etcdâ€™s read index ensures linearizability by coordinating between follower and leader nodes, but this process introduces increased latency as cluster size grows. Higher latency can hinder performance in applications requiring fast, frequent reads. This paper proposes a lease-based approach to reduce read index latency while maintaining consistency. The method aims to balance responsiveness and data accuracy in large-scale etcd deployments.

**Latency**:\
Latency is a metric used to measure the time delay in processing requests in a system.

**Key Contributions:** 
* **Algorithm Development** \
  Designed and optimized Lease based latency methodology targetting by reducing the latency.
* **Performance Comparison** \
  Conducted bench marking between ReadIndex Latency and Lease Based Latency.
* **Reserach Leadership**
  Led the research and technical implementation , focusing on advancing distributed database through algorithm innovation.

**Relevance & Real-World Impact**
* **Kubernetes infrastructure optimization:**\
    Boosts distributed key-value store efficiency by minimizing read latency through intelligent lease management.
* **Read Latency Optimization:** \
    Lease-Based reads maintain consistently low latency as cluster size increases, improving responsiveness for read-intensive workloads. This approach reduces coordination overhead compared to quorum-based methods, enhancing overall query performance. \

*  **Academic Recogition:** \
  Featured in academic publications and technical reports centered on DNS resolution processes and efficiency gains within ETCD systems.
